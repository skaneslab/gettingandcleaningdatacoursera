  - run_analysis.R is a R script that does the following :
  
      1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
      2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
      3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
      5 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity         and each subject.
      
  - tidy_data_set.txt is the final tidy data set created in step 5
